  what: `We support and invent ways to learn about nonviolent principles and tools as individuals, in our interactions with others, and in the groups and structures of which we’re a part and with whom we work, inspiring other people to look at [NVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) and other tools to enrich their lives.`,
  why: `We know that there is different way of communicating, working and studying, enjoying life and using power. We want to see a world where nobody dies from starvation, that rather than wars, conflict is resolved through dialogue. We believe Nonviolent Communication is a tool which contributes to the systemic changes to make dreams come true because it’s our experience at home, at work, and in the world. We would like people to be able to access this tool and become more active in social change to create more peace in the world.

  The platform allows everyone anywhere in the world the opportunity to learn from the comfort and safety of their own home. We hope this platform will become a global website where courses are held by different teams, different trainers and different languages.`,
