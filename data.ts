  about: `With so many unknowns about COVID-19, the core trainer team of the annual European Intensive Course decided that this year’s event would be held virtually so you can learn and deepen your Nonviolent Communication (NVC) skills in the safety and comfort of your own home.

  Peace Factory is **honoured and thrilled** to offer you a ground-breaking way to engage in learning Nonviolent Communication - an 8 day Virtual Intensive Course (VIC), aiming to **encourage and promote intercultural dialogue** and citizenship during this period where face-to-face International Intensive Trainings (IITs) have been cancelled due to health concerns.

  You probably already know NVC as a communication tool to **improve relationships, bringing us closer to ourselves and to those around us**. Yet it also points to how we can replace the dehumanising systems in which most of us grew up, allowing us to create better ways to be together, **sharing power with each other**.

  Peace Factory has taken the lead to design and build the virtual platform, and supported by a team of people, we have become an exemplary example of using NVC to work well together. Even when deadlines have been tight, we took into account the humanity of each person before doing any task, and we only did tasks we loved to do!  So you can rest assured there has been no coercion in the making of this course and during the VIC, we are proud to showcase the process we used to work together.

  We are all **delighted and passionate** about exploring together with you the breadth and depth of Nonviolent Communication, and keen to **grow as a community** to extend well beyond the 8 days spent together.

  This course is obviously about learning and practicing NVC skills and yet it's so much more than this.

  Join us from **31st July to 9th August**, for the first Virtual Intensive Course (VIC), especially geared to support NVC learning for people living in African/European time zones.

  If you are motivated and have a desire to integrate the spirit of NVC into all aspects of life, this is the course for you!`,
  course: `The course starts on 31st of July and ends on 9th of August, 8 days in total. Full of NVC activities, each day has individual choices for your level of engagement according to your own learning needs. Our experience is that our daily schedule supports group’s needs (schedule will be shared with the participants before the event).

  <div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="language">
  Language
  </div>

  **English** is used as our shared common language during community sessions and there is translation English/French/English for all community meetings (sessions one and four).

  Two workshops a day are also translated from English into French: one every morning, one every afternoon (sessions two and three).

  No other translation is envisaged by the organisers, although our experience is that many bilingual people are happy to jump in when necessary on an ad hoc basis. You can also buy a ticket for two and work side by side with your own interpreter.

  <div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="what-to-expect">

  </div>

  - **Richness and diversity**: Every year there are participants from many countries and this tremendous inter-cultural diversity adds to the richness of experience and exploration.
  - **Depth and breadth**: Throughout the course, along numerous training sessions and community meetings, we explore together a needs-based consciousness in all facets of life – in relationship to self, others and life, at home and at work, in relationship to inner as well as outer resources. We want to fully explore what life is and what it can be, from the very practical realms to the deeply spiritual ones. No theme is off-topic and everything is embraced.
  - **Community**: We aim to live equality in our community, exploring and creating together. We are aware of different talents and passions we bring into the course and this diversity proves to be a contributing element.

  <div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="what-you-need">
  What you need?
  </div>

  A webcam, microphone and a stable internet connection. It’s that simple!

  All the meetings will take place on <a href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a> which is compatible with Microsoft or Apple. After registering, if you’re new to Zoom, you can access detailed information about how to use it and be supported with technical aspects. Peace Factory has 9 years of experience offering on-line courses, so you’re in good hands.

  <div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="course-content">
  Course Content
  </div>

  Through a range of activities, the VIC aims to expand the reach and scope of technology-enabled people-to-people courses sustained over a period of 8 days. **Co-created with you to provide a safe container where everybody taps into the living energy of an emerging community**, you can participate, experiment and facilitate learning with 10 experienced trainers, all certified with CNVC, to learn skills which are quickly transferred into daily life, making profound changes to how we live.

  With a ratio of about ten people per trainer, the programme structure is intensive, with some participants who have NVC skills and awareness well beyond the early levels, whilst others are starting their NVC journey.

  The course is designed to promote the integration and sustainability of work throughout the following year and in addition to the eight-day course in August, there is an option for small groups to stay in active contact once a fortnight and to enjoy monthly mentoring from one of the trainers.

  Our programme includes deepening awareness of needs, integrating NVC skills, handling conflicts, basics of mediation, personal growth and spiritual aspects of NVC, deep self-empathy, transforming enemy images and the pain of unmet needs, so that we can:

    - explore and identify personal core beliefs and create new cognitive structures that emanate directly from our living needs;
    - reduce the level of pain carried in our systems so that we are able to generate lives of satisfaction and empowerment;
    - honour power-with leadership models like Systemic Consensing[1] and Open Space Technology;
    - shift from scarcity thinking (an inherent part of a domination system) to the consciousness of plenty;
    - study the belief systems of money and practice how resources can flow from a perspective of abundance;
    - move from chronic struggle and “busy-ness” to a sense of flow and ease in our lives.

  Attendance at an IIT is a request of those who wish to become CNVC certified trainers, and whilst it is highly recommended to anyone who wishes to share NVC, whether you want to be certified or not, this course is also recognised as equivalent to an IIT.

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is Nonviolent Communication?',
      answer: `Nonviolent communication (NVC) is an approach and a way of living that aims to bring any human being closer to themself and to others around them. Above all, it serves as a compass for creating a life that aligns with our deepest values, moment to moment.

  Through a set of tools for listening to our deepest needs and feelings, NVC gives us an opportunity to have effective communication with people around us, and helps us solve conflict in a compassionate and connecting way. In addition, NVC can be used for designing life-supporting communities and systems, in government, business, schools, and more.

  NVC was developed by Marshall Rosenberg, an American psychologist, who was the Educational Director of CNVC, the world-wide organisation that brings NVC together on a global basis.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'I know nothing about Nonviolent Communication. Can I come?',
      answer: `You’re so welcome! There is no experience required to join and we have a special beginners track for the first 3 days designed just for you!`,
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do some people attend the course each year?',
      answer: `Even the more experienced participants don’t find an intensive course repetitive. Course materials are continually evolving, so it’s somewhat different from year to year. Additionally people report that the material is so rich that they hear something different even if a topic is the same! Most important, peer learning is an integral part of our course. Having applied the material in their lives for a year, they enrich and broaden the programme for everybody. They may coach during mediation role-plays, offer empathy and support between training sessions so first-time participants get all the support they could want throughout the course.`,
    },
    {
      question:
        'My English is not very fluent. Are you sure I can participate?',
      answer: `We’re confident because most of the team speak English as a second or third language, so it’s simple and slow. But if you’d like to check it out, please book a 10 minute exchange with <a href="mailto:Irmtraud.kauschat@yahoo.de">Irmtraud</a>`,
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I offer workshops during the course?',
      answer: `Yes, if a trainer is willing to be present with you, otherwise there is plenty of space for you to lead workshops outside the daily schedule.

  Learning NVC is very much like learning a new language. And we all know that the best way to become fluent a new language is to immerse yourself in an environment where others are speaking and learning it too. This is not the kind of training where you can fill up a notebook, put it on the shelf, and call it done. You need to incorporate what you learn into your being. The training is an opportunity for you to learn in a context where you are safe to push yourself, let down your guard a little and try some new things, be present a little longer when you become uncomfortable with conflict, and grow with each incremental step you take. `,
    },
    {
      question: 'Why limit the number of people for the course?',
      answer: `This is not designed as a festival or gathering, it’s a course for skill building, and so the number of people is limited to assure the learning aspects.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is an EIC and a VIC?',
      answer: `
  - Normally, the EIC (European Intensive Course) is an 8-day event  organised every year by Peace Factory in France, Europe. The VIC is a virtual format of the same course.
  -  An experiential workshop for developing fluency in Nonviolent Communication
  - An opportunity to learn and practice Nonviolent Communication with Peace Factory certified trainers
  - A safe environment for personal growth
  - A time to make deep connections
  - A group of people from different cultures working together toward transformed relationships and social systems
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What will it be like?',
      answer: `Unpredictable, Informal, Challenging and supportive`,
    },
    {
      question: 'How will I learn?',
      answer: `
  - By listening to presentations about various aspects of Nonviolent Communication
  - By participating in small groups and through informal practice with other participants
  - By remembering the purpose of Nonviolent Communication
  - By contributing to other participants and receiving their contributions
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a “Remembering”?',
      answer: `The Remembering Sessions help participants be aware of the purpose underlying NVC. Participants who wish to share may express this remembering with a short exercise, a ceremony, poem, musical selection, a reading, etc. If you would enjoy doing so, please bring materials to contribute to the Remembering Sessions.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'The video platform, how does it work?',
      answer: `It’s an easy to use platform and our technical team who are all trained in NVC are here to help you. Technical glitches are a normal part of any virtual course. Rather than panic and blame, they are handled with grace and support.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the format and structure?',
      answer: `To provide participants with a choice of learning opportunities VIC’s typically operate in a manner that is similar to the principles of Open Space Technology. For more information about the principles, please look at www.openspaceworld.org
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the start and end times?',
      answer: `All times quoted are Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)+2  (like in Berlin, Budapest, Cairo, Harare, Kigali, Ljubljana, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Oslo, Stockholm, Warsaw)
      On day 1: the scheduled start of the program (first meeting) is at 09:30
      On (last) day 8:The last meeting ends at 17:50

    {
      question: 'Are sessions recorded?',
      answer: `We plan to film and record parts of the sessions at the VIC which do not include a personal or group process. These recording are accessible only by participants for the next 12 months so you can carry on learning from the sessions.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the VIC cancellations and refunds policies?',
      answer: `Peace Factory incurs significant expenses with every application processed, so we request that you refrain from applying for an VIC unless your plans are firm, and you are confident of your ability to attend.

  In the event that the VIC 2020 does not take place, the VIC enrollee agrees that Peace Factory shall have no obligation to compensate the VIC enrollee above paid VIC tuition. (In such an event, Peace Factory may offer to reassign the payment to another VIC or Peace Factory workshop, if this is the VIC enrollee’s preference.)

  In the event that you cancel your VIC application, Peace Factory will ask how you would like us to handle any monies you have already sent us for the VIC. At your request, prepaid TUITION fees (minus the nonrefundable part of your payment as described below) may be donated to Peace Factory to defray administrative expenses, refunded, or reassigned to a specific, later VIC.

  The nonrefundable portion of the fee is €100.

  Please remember: To be eligible for consideration, please submit your completed Tuition Reduction Request at least one week before the start of the VIC. The form is here
      Late applications will not be considered.

  To minimise the chance of disappointing you, we would like you to know that Peace Factory’s tuition reduction funding is limited. We do not expect to give tuition reductions to all, or even most, of those who apply. Please note also that Peace Factory rarely offers reductions to applicants other than those from developing countries. We use the following criteria in selecting recipients:

  1. Potential of applicant to share NVC widely, especially among populations not already reached.
  2. Economic need, especially if resulting from circumstances beyond one's control.
  3. Previous NVC training (those with more training will generally be given preference over those with less training).
  4. Connection to the CNVC community, and previous contribution to the Peace Factory community.
  5. Except in extraordinary circumstances, reductions are not offered to people who have previously attended an NVC intensive course.

      question: 'What is the waiting list procedure?',
      answer: `Once the places on the VIC are filled, Peace Factory creates a waiting list.

There is no guarantee that a space will open up.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'I attended an intensive before; can I attend again?',
      answer: `Yes. People find great value in attending intensives several time during their NVC journey.

    {
      question:
        'Is attendance of an intensive training still required for a CNVC Certified Trainer?',
      answer: `_Please note the change in language regarding Intensive trainings and certification. In an effort to support clarity and easy access to information, here is the updated language._

  We strongly recommend candidates to attend an IIT before becoming certified, but we are no longer in integrity with having a "requirement" in the CPP. So we have come up with the following requests if a candidate does not attend an IIT before becoming certified:

  - Multi-day, in-depth, residential training
  - International NVC experience
  - Areas fully experienced: NVC community (ongoing peer support), spirituality, and social change
  - Significant NVC experience with multiple CNVC certified trainers and mentors
  - Established a connection to CNVC, have a clear priority to support Peace Factory's mission, willing and able to renew annual certification
