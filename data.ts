  about: `Peace Factory's team is delighted to offer you a ground-breaking way to engage in learning Nonviolent Communication - a 2 day online course, aimed at encouraging and promoting intercultural dialogue and citizenship.

  NVC is a communication tool that improves relationships, bringing us closer to ourselves and to those around us. It also points to how we can replace the dehumanising systems in which most of us grew up, allowing us to create better ways to be together, sharing power with each other.

  Peace Factory has taken the lead to design and build the virtual exchange platform, and supported by a team of people, we have become an exemplary example of using NVC to work well together. Even when deadlines have been tight, we took into account the humanity of each person before doing any task, and we only did tasks we loved to do! So you can rest assured there has been no coercion in the making of this course and we are pleased to showcase the process we used to work together.

  We are all delighted and passionate about exploring together with you the breadth and depth of Nonviolent Communication, and keen to grow as a community to extend well beyond the 2 days spent together.

  This course is obviously about learning and practising NVC skills with certified trainers and yet it's so much more than this. Full of NVC activities, each day has individual choices for your level of engagement according to your own learning needs.

  Join us the weekend of 8th and 9th August, especially geared to support NVC learning for people living in Africa/Europe UTC 0 to +4 time zones.

  If you are motivated and have a desire to integrate the spirit of NVC into all aspects of life, this is the course for you!`,
  course: `The course starts on 8th of August and ends on 9th of August, 2 days in total. Full of NVC activities, each day has individual choices for your level of engagement according to your own learning needs. Our experience is that our daily schedule supports group’s needs (schedule will be shared with the participants before the event).

  <div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="language">
  Language
  </div>

  **English** is used as our shared common language during all sessions.

  No translation is envisaged by the organisers, although our experience is that many bilingual people are happy to jump in when necessary on an ad hoc basis. You can also buy one ticket for two and work side by side with your own interpreter.

<div class="py-4 h3 text-center" id="what-you-need">
What you need?
</div>

A webcam, microphone and a stable internet connection. It’s that simple!

  All the meetings will take place on [Zoom](https://zoom.us) which is compatible with Microsoft or Apple. After registering, if you’re new to Zoom, you can access detailed information about how to use it and be supported with technical aspects. Peace Factory has 9 years of experience offering on-line courses, so you’re in good hands.

  Course Content
  </div>

  Through a range of activities, the VIC aims to expand the reach and scope of technology-enabled people-to-people courses sustained over a period of 8 days. **Co-created with you to provide a safe container where everybody taps into the living energy of an emerging community**, you can participate, experiment and facilitate learning with 10 experienced trainers, all certified with CNVC, to learn skills which are quickly transferred into daily life, making profound changes to how we live.

  With a ratio of about ten people per trainer, the programme structure is intensive, with some participants who have NVC skills and awareness well beyond the early levels, whilst others are starting their NVC journey.

  The course is designed to promote the integration and sustainability of work throughout the following year and in addition to the eight-day course in August, there is an option for small groups to stay in active contact once a fortnight and to enjoy monthly mentoring from one of the trainers.

  Our programme includes deepening awareness of needs, integrating NVC skills, handling conflicts, basics of mediation, personal growth and spiritual aspects of NVC, deep self-empathy, transforming enemy images and the pain of unmet needs, so that we can:

  - explore and identify personal core beliefs and create new cognitive structures that emanate directly from our living needs;
  - reduce the level of pain carried in our systems so that we are able to generate lives of satisfaction and empowerment;
  - honour power-with leadership models like Systemic Consensing and Open Space Technology;
  - shift from scarcity thinking (an inherent part of a domination system) to the consciousness of plenty;
  - study the belief systems of money and practice how resources can flow from a perspective of abundance;
  - move from chronic struggle and “busy-ness” to a sense of flow and ease in our lives.

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is Nonviolent Communication?',
      answer: `Nonviolent communication (NVC) is an approach and a way of living that aims to bring any human being closer to themself and to others around them. Above all, it serves as a compass for creating a life that aligns with our deepest values, moment to moment.

  Through a set of tools for listening to our deepest needs and feelings, NVC gives us an opportunity to have effective communication with people around us, and helps us solve conflict in a compassionate and connecting way. In addition, NVC can be used for designing life-supporting communities and systems, in government, business, schools, and more.

  NVC was developed by Marshall Rosenberg, an American psychologist, who was the Educational Director of CNVC, the world-wide organisation that brings NVC together on a global basis.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'I know nothing about Nonviolent Communication. Can I come?',
      answer: `You’re so welcome! There is no experience required to join and we have a special beginners track for the first 3 days designed just for you!`,
    },
    /* {
      question: 'Why do some people attend the course each year?',
      answer: `Even the more experienced participants don’t find an intensive course repetitive. Course materials are continually evolving, so it’s somewhat different from year to year. Additionally people report that the material is so rich that they hear something different even if a topic is the same! Most important, peer learning is an integral part of our course. Having applied the material in their lives for a year, they enrich and broaden the programme for everybody. They may coach during mediation role-plays, offer empathy and support between training sessions so first-time participants get all the support they could want throughout the course.`,
    }, */
    /* {
      question:
        'My English is not very fluent. Are you sure I can participate?',
      answer: `We’re confident because most of the team speak English as a second or third language, so it’s simple and slow. But if you’d like to check it out, please book a 10 minute exchange with <a href="mailto:${irmtraud_email}">Irmtraud</a>`,
    }, */
    {
      question: 'Can I offer workshops during the course?',
      answer: `Yes, if a trainer is willing to be present with you, otherwise there is plenty of space for you to lead workshops outside the daily schedule.

  Learning NVC is very much like learning a new language. And we all know that the best way to become fluent a new language is to immerse yourself in an environment where others are speaking and learning it too. This is not the kind of training where you can fill up a notebook, put it on the shelf, and call it done. You need to incorporate what you learn into your being. The training is an opportunity for you to learn in a context where you are safe to push yourself, let down your guard a little and try some new things, be present a little longer when you become uncomfortable with conflict, and grow with each incremental step you take. `,
    },
    {
      question: 'Why limit the number of people for the course?',
      answer: `This is not designed as a festival or gathering, it’s a course for skill building, and so the number of people is limited to assure the learning aspects.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is an EIC and a VIC?',
      answer: `
  - Normally, the EIC (European Intensive Course) is an 8-day event  organised every year by Peace Factory in France, Europe. The VIC is a virtual format of the same course.
  -  An experiential workshop for developing fluency in Nonviolent Communication
  - An opportunity to learn and practice Nonviolent Communication with Peace Factory certified trainers
  - A safe environment for personal growth
  - A time to make deep connections
  - A group of people from different cultures working together toward transformed relationships and social systems

      question: 'How will I learn?',
      answer: `
  - By listening to presentations about various aspects of Nonviolent Communication
  - By participating in small groups and through informal practice with other participants
  - By remembering the purpose of Nonviolent Communication
  - By contributing to other participants and receiving their contributions
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a “Remembering”?',
      answer: `The Remembering Sessions help participants be aware of the purpose underlying NVC. Participants who wish to share may express this remembering with a short exercise, a ceremony, poem, musical selection, a reading, etc. If you would enjoy doing so, please bring materials to contribute to the Remembering Sessions.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'The video platform, how does it work?',
      answer: `It’s an easy to use platform and our technical team who are all trained in NVC are here to help you. Technical glitches are a normal part of any virtual course. Rather than panic and blame, they are handled with grace and support.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the format and structure?',

  In the event that the VIC 2020 does not take place, the VIC enrollee agrees that Peace Factory shall have no obligation to compensate the VIC enrollee above paid VIC tuition.

  1. Potential of applicant to share NVC widely, especially among populations not already reached.
  2. Economic need, especially if resulting from circumstances beyond one's control.
  3. Previous NVC training (those with more training will generally be given preference over those with less training).
  4. Connection to the CNVC community, and previous contribution to the Peace Factory community.
  5. Except in extraordinary circumstances, reductions are not offered to people who have previously attended an NVC intensive course.

  We strongly recommend candidates to attend an IIT before becoming certified, but we are no longer in integrity with having a "requirement" in the CPP. So we have come up with the following requests if a candidate does not attend an IIT before becoming certified:

  - Multi-day, in-depth, residential training
  - International NVC experience
  - Areas fully experienced: NVC community (ongoing peer support), spirituality, and social change
  - Significant NVC experience with multiple CNVC certified trainers and mentors

      bio: `Trained by Marshall Rosenberg, Godfrey became a CNVC Certified Trainer in 2001.  He has been approached by universities, professional organisations of lawyers, the judiciary, university hospitals, companies, business schools and governments... for which he acts as a coach and mediator, as well as a teacher of mediation and negotiation. In 2004, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) International.

  Since 2006, he has been regularly called to Senegal and the Gambia (2019) to mediate between the Casamance rebel factions and also between rebel leaders and the Government.  In 2016, he was invited to work alongside HH Dalai Lama in the framework of the "Mind & Life Dialogue".

  > “I thoroughly enjoy the sense of belonging generated before, during and after intensives.  I moved from interpreting IITs for Marshall in the French-speaking world to assisting him when Marshall was IIT lead-trainer.  I was invited by Louise Romain to facilitate the European Intensive Course at the Peace Factory in the Pyrenees for ten years.

  > “I am especially turned on by life in the present, experiencing how past and future can become eminently manageable when brought into the here and now.  Intensives produce order in chaos!  The unexpected can prove to be a real pedagogue!  Pushing back the borders of classical NVC helps learners to integrate the power of this process in their day-to-day interactions.

  > “Social change stems from inner change.  Let’s remember that inner change is the real challenge, while changing the world is a perilous illusion.  Participants on my courses say how much they enjoy the passion, the novelty, the rigour, the the language skills, the clarity…  and the impression that time flies!”

  Godfrey has developed a passion for self-empathy as a springboard to empathy for others and the development of quality relationships in the service of increased productivity.  He started his career as a linguist and laboured under the illusion that communication was all about sequences of semantic fields. A ten-year stint manning the IBM Europe International Effective Communication programme tended to confirm this!

  He later did two NLP masters, one in the US and the other in France. Still hungry for something more, he was advised by one of his university students to meet Marshall Rosenberg!  The encounter changed his life.  For the first time, he experienced the power of compassion, both for himself and for others.

  He trains, mediates and coaches in English and French, basing his whole approach on NVC.  His clients range from couples to individual professionals; from major international institutions, such as the European Commission, to banks large and small, from local corporations to government institutions.

  Having learnt so much from settling up her freelance business in her early 20’s, Louise worked as a human resources consultant within client business organisations until becoming a mother to two children, and then the learning notched up a gear.

  Serving as an assistant at more than 10 IITs with Marshall Rosenberg, with whom she did all her training, she is thoroughly convinced of the benefits of immersion training, and since 2011 she has organised two intensive courses every summer, one in French and one with a European reach. The courses are hosted at Peace Factory in South-West France where her role is director.

  Since becoming a trainer certified with CNVC in 2007, she enjoys working as a personal, professional, and organisational development trainer and consultant, particularly delighting in working clients using Agile and Liberating company approaches (teal organisations), whilst still keeping time to contribute to and develop the eco-community where she lives.

  Louise is motivated to travel in order to serve a community, recently training more than 500 school directors and teachers in Nepal, aligned with her vision to contribute to peacebuilding.
  She is also trained in physiotherapy and art foundry.

  Peace Factory is proud to be hosting this VIC with the endorsement and support of CNVC.
